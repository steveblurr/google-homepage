This exciting project is about dissecting a website. I will be mimicing how Google.Com looks. 


Some of the skills that are demonstrated here are:
DIV AND SPAN
HEADERS AND FOOTERS
USING CSS FOR MARGIN, PADDING
I created a basic form to include the search bar, also did some googling to find out how to removed the small (x) when using the input selector. 

*******
NOTES: I struggled to figure out how to keep all the text within the header and footer aligned when the page gets resized. Some of my text got while shrinking down. 

I played around with whatever I was able to find until I figured it out. However, I'm still not sure how i figured it out. 

from my [footer id= "bottom-page] I removed the [display: inline-flex;] and this seemed to solve the problem.]
